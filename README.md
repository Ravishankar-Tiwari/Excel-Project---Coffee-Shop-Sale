# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is designed to analyze retail sales data from a coffee shop to uncover actionable insights that can improve sales performance and operational strategies. The analysis focuses on key performance indicators such as sales revenue, footfall, peak sales hours, and the most popular products. The insights derived from the data will help optimize store operations and marketing strategies.

## Key Features
- **Sales by Time of Day**: Understand how sales fluctuate based on the time of day and identify peak sales hours.
- **Sales by Day of Week**: Identify trends in sales over the week to plan staffing and promotional efforts.
- **Monthly Sales Revenue**: Calculate and compare sales revenue for each month.
- **Location-based Sales Performance**: Evaluate how different store locations perform in terms of sales and footfall.
- **Average Order Value**: Calculate the average sales per person and identify opportunities to increase order values.
- **Top Selling Products**: Identify the best-selling products based on quantity sold and revenue generated.
- **Product Category Performance**: Analyze the performance of different product categories and product types.

## Data Description
The project uses historical sales data from the coffee shop, including transactional details such as:
- **Transaction ID**
- **Transaction Date & Time**
- **Store Location**
- **Product ID, Name, and Category**
- **Quantity Sold**
- **Unit Price**
- **Total Bill**
- **Size of Order**
- **Month and Day of the Week**

The dataset includes multiple Excel and pivot files that provide comprehensive insights into the sales performance of the coffee shop.

## Analysis Goals
1. **Identify Peak Sales Times**: Understand how sales vary during the day and which hours or days see the highest sales volume.
2. **Revenue Tracking**: Track total sales revenue by month and location.
3. **Footfall Analysis**: Compare the footfall (number of customers) to sales revenue and determine any correlation.
4. **Product and Category Performance**: Discover which products are generating the most sales and which categories are most profitable.
5. **Operational Efficiency**: Based on the analysis, make recommendations on optimizing store operations, product offerings, and promotional strategies.

##Insights & Recommendations
Sales are typically higher on weekends, with Sunday and Saturday being the busiest days for customers.
The most popular products include brewed espresso and black tea, which are responsible for the highest revenue.
Footfall tends to correlate with sales, but there are opportunities to increase average order values during peak times by offering targeted promotions or upselling.

##Future Improvements
Integration with live sales data for real-time analysis.
Adding machine learning models to predict sales based on historical trends.
Incorporating customer data to better understand buying patterns.
